  // FAQ Tab
  'private.faq.title': 'Frequently Asked Questions',
  'private.faq.q1': 'How are private lessons different from group classes?',
  'private.faq.a1': 'Private lessons offer a completely personalized experience tailored to your specific learning style, goals, and pace. You receive 100% of the instructor\'s attention, allowing for immediate feedback, customized materials, and flexibility in scheduling. Unlike group classes, private lessons can adapt on the fly to focus on areas where you need more support or acceleration.',
  'private.faq.q2': 'How do I know which package is right for me?',
  'private.faq.a2': 'The Basic Package is ideal for beginners, short-term goals, or those wanting to try private instruction before committing to more sessions. The Standard Package works well for most learners who want consistent progress over time. The Premium Package is designed for intensive learning, professional needs, or those with specific specialized goals. We recommend starting with a free trial session where we can assess your needs and recommend the best option.',
  'private.faq.q3': 'What happens in the free trial session?',
  'private.faq.a3': 'The 30-minute free trial session serves as both an assessment and introduction. We\'ll discuss your learning goals, assess your current Spanish level (if any), answer your questions, and demonstrate our teaching approach. This helps us customize a learning plan specifically for you and ensures we\'re a good match before you commit to any package.',
  'private.faq.q4': 'Can I share my private lessons with a friend or partner?',
  'private.faq.a4': 'Yes, you can share your package with one additional person at the same Spanish level for a 30% surcharge. This creates a semi-private lesson experience while still maintaining a high level of personalization. Both participants must attend the same sessions together.',
  'private.faq.q5': 'Can I request a specific instructor?',
  'private.faq.a5': 'Yes, you can. If you don\'t specify, we\'ll match you with the instructor best suited to your needs and goals.',
  'private.faq.q6': 'What payment methods are accepted?',
  'private.faq.a6': 'You can choose the method that works best for you: CCP, bank transfer, Visa or Mastercard. After confirmation, you can start immediately with the teacher based on availability. If you cannot pay using these methods, email us at spanishwithseif@gmail.com and we\'ll help you.',
  'private.faq.q7': 'Can I cancel or reschedule a lesson?',
  'private.faq.a7': 'Yes, provided you notify us at least 12 hours in advance to avoid losing the session. For emergencies (health issues, urgent circumstances), let us know and we\'ll find an appropriate solution.',
  'private.faq.q8': 'How quickly will I progress with private lessons?',
  'private.faq.a8': 'Progress varies based on several factors including your starting level, language learning background, practice time between sessions, and learning goals. However, private students typically progress 2-3 times faster than in group settings due to the personalized attention and customized approach. We\'ll set clear milestones and regularly assess your progress.',
